                    Welcome to the MindTheGapHack, where young minds come together to bridge the gap between perception and reality! Our hackathon is inspired by the Gapminder Ignorance Project, which highlights the common misconceptions people have about global development, health, and human progress.

This event challenges high school students and middle schoolers (7th and 8th graders) to hack ignorance by using data, technology, and creative problem-solving. Participants will create innovative solutions to combat widespread misinformation.

The media and popular belief often misrepresent global trends, leaving many unaware of the real progress happening worldwide. By participating in this hackathon, students will learn to work with real-world data, develop coding and analytical skills, and gain a deeper understanding of critical global issuesâ€”while also having a lot of fun!</p>
